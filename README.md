# Earth Quakes

**Note:**
I worked with Aman Gill for this challenge. We followed pair-programming methodology and the code and readme was co-created.


## **Objective:**

Objective of this application is to map the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plate's location on the earth, and to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map (Dark Mode).

The Earth Quake data representation can be found here:

Here are the screen print of the resulting map

**December Percipitation**

Looking at the summary of temperature and percipitation, Oahu looks like an ideal place for an Ice Cream and Surf store, ALOHA!!
